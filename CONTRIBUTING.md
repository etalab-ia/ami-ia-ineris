# How to contribute ?

The new developments to be brought to this project are recommended to be done through a merge-request to the master branch.

## What standards should I respect ?

The source code should respect the [**PEP8**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Style Guide for Python and should be formatted with the[**Python-Black**](https://github.com/python/black) editor. It is a plus if you format your docstrings according to the [**PEP257**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

## What about tests?

By default, tests are not enforced. It is recommended, though, to do the following tests:
* Unit tests (`pytest`)
* Code Style tests (`black`)
* Automatic testing (`pyflakes`)
* Security tests (`bandit`)

More information can be found on how to implement these tests in [this link](https://git.sia-partners.com/heka/core/blob/master/README.md).
